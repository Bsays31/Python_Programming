#Set items cannot be accessed by referring to an index, since sets are unordered the items has no index. 
# But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.

#Python program to demonstrate
# Accessing of elements in a set
 
# Creating a set
set1 = set(["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"])
print("\nInitial set")
print(set1)
 
# Accessing element using
# for loop
print("\nElements of set: ")
for i in set1:
    print(i)
 
# Checking the element
# using in keyword
print()

print("Geeks" in set1)
