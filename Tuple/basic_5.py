# Slicing of a Tuple is done to fetch a specific range or slice of sub-elements from a Tuple.
# Slicing can also be done to lists and arrays. Indexing in a list results to fetching a single element whereas Slicing
# allows to fetch a set of elements.

# Note- Negative Increment values can also be used to reverse the sequence of Tuples. 

# Slicing of a Tuple
# with Numbers
Tuple1 = tuple('GEEKSFORGEEKS')

# Removing First element
print("Removal of First Element: ")
print(Tuple1[1:])

# Rempving Last element
print("\nRemoval of the last element: ")
print(Tuple1[:-1])

# Reversing the Tuple
print("\nTuple after sequence of Element is reversed: ")
print(Tuple1[::-1])

# Printing elements of a Range
print("\nPrinting elements between Range 4-9: ")
print(Tuple1[4:9])

# Deletion of tuple
print("\nDeletion of tuple :")
tuple2 = (1,2,3,4,5)
del tuple2
#Print(tuple2)
